# Marketing Assistant for Merchants

A one-stop, web-based solution designed to assist merchants in preparing customer-facing product descriptions across different platforms.

## User Problems

When a new product is about to launch, preparing product descriptions can be a significant headache due to the amount of time, marketing expertise, and attention to detail it requires. Merchants juggle between different marketing tools and customer-facing platforms, tweaking their descriptions to ensure that their product description remains on-brand and optimized for each platform. More precisely, they need to ensure all of the following are true:
- The tone of the copy remains consistent with other published content.
- The copy is optimized for Google Search, especially if it's shared through a publicly available website.
- The copy considers the target audience to ensure it resonates more with them.
- The copy is suitable for different platforms (for example, it often needs to be more specific for Google Merchant Center, shorter and more casual for Instagram, and can include more URLs to other products on YouTube).

## Solution
